# Veeva Approved Email Dropdown Builder

Primarily this repo contains a website that allows users to create and modify Veeva dropdown options. And more importantly validates them to ensure copywriters and designers are following the Veeva guidelines when using dropdowns.

This project is created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [Redux tookit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), and [TailWindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Installation

Run `npm i` to install node dependencies.

Afterwards run `npm run start` to start the website on your browser on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Deployment

Requires merging the latest code to the `main` branch. Afterwards the repo will be deployed to Render where it will automatically compile the latest by running `npm run build`.
