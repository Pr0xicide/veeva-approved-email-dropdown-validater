# [Veeva Approved Email Dropdown Validater](https://veeva-approved-email-dropdown-validater.onrender.com)

This website is mainly for people who are new or unfamiliar with [Veeva approved emails](https://www.veeva.com/products/crm-suite/approved-email/) and don't know all the restrictions and limitations with dropdown tokens. Particularly for those with non technical backgrounds.

To be more specific, this lets you:

1. build your own dropdown token from a list of options you define
2. paste in existing tokens to display all the options to the user **making easer to read and review**
